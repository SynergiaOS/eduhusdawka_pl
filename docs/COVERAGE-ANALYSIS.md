  - Page components need integration tests

### `/components` - React Components
- **Status**: Moderate coverage
- **Well Covered**:
  - `contact-form.tsx` - Comprehensive form testing
  - `unified-image.tsx` - Image handling and error states
  - `appointment-form.tsx` - User interaction testing

### `/hooks` - Custom React Hooks
- **Status**: Good coverage
- **Well Covered**:
  - `use-analytics.ts` - 100% coverage
  - `use-common-patterns.ts` - 67% coverage
  - `use-accessibility.ts` - Accessibility features

### `/lib` - Utilities and Services
- **Status**: Mixed coverage
- **Well Covered**:
  - `seo-utils.ts` - 98% coverage
  - `utils.ts` - 100% coverage
- **Needs Improvement**:
  - `analytics.ts` - 40% coverage
  - `performance-utils.ts` - 0% coverage

## Priority Areas for Improvement

### 1. API Routes and Server Actions
**Target**: 80%+ coverage
**Files to test**:
- `app/actions/contact-form.ts`
- `app/actions/booking-actions.ts`
- `app/api/sms-queue/route.ts`

### 2. Component Integration Tests
**Target**: 80%+ coverage
**Files to test**:
- Navigation components
- Form validation workflows
- Error boundary scenarios

### 3. Performance Testing
**Target**: 60%+ coverage
**Files to test**:
- `lib/performance-utils.ts`
- Component performance optimization
- Memory leak detection

### 4. Error Handling
**Target**: 80%+ coverage
**Files to test**:
- `lib/error-handling.ts`
- Enhanced error boundaries
- Async error scenarios

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Fix failing test files
   - Add missing component tests
   - Implement API route testing

2. **Short-term Goals**:
   - Reach 60% coverage for core features
   - Add integration test suites
   - Improve error handling tests

3. **Long-term Goals**:
   - Achieve 80%+ coverage across all modules
   - Implement automated coverage monitoring
   - Add performance regression tests

## Coverage Requirements

### Minimum Thresholds
- **Overall**: 80%
- **Functions**: 80%
- **Branches**: 80%
- **Lines**: 80%
- **Statements**: 80%

### Critical Files
- Must maintain 90%+ coverage:
  - Analytics utilities
  - SEO utilities
  - Form components
  - Error handling

### Acceptable Thresholds
- Can maintain 60%+ coverage:
  - Third-party integrations
  - Utility helpers
  - Static components

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Component rendering and behavior
- Utility function validation
- Hook state management

### Integration Tests
- Form submission workflows
- API interaction patterns
- User journey scenarios

### Performance Tests
- Component render performance
- Memory usage monitoring
- Load testing for critical paths

### Accessibility Tests
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation
- ARIA attribute validation

## Quality Gates

Coverage requirements will be enforced through:
- Jest configuration thresholds
- CI/CD pipeline validation
- Pre-commit hooks for coverage changes
- Regular coverage reporting

## Conclusion

The current coverage of ~37% needs significant improvement to meet the 80% target. Focus should be placed on critical business logic, API endpoints, and user-facing components. Implementing the strategies outlined above will help achieve comprehensive test coverage while maintaining code quality and reliability.
